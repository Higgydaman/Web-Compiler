// Some stuff that is not quite right that I would like to be
1) Math is not really correct......suggest loading the entire expression and then evaluating wiht PEMDAS
2) Negative numbers is not really working
3) Need to use try/catch methods for ALL table indexes
4) Make the display side read only

// Internal errors
"Internal error 0."

// Some debugs I like
// let index = 0;
                //         console.log("LIST:");
                //         while(temp_array[index] != "undefined" && typeof temp_array[index] != 'undefined' && temp_array[index] != null) {
                //                 console.log(temp_array[index]);
                //                 index++;
                //         }
